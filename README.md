## Technologies Used

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
* **Jetpack Compose:** Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
* **Jetpack Navigation Compose:** For managing in-app navigation.
* **Room Persistence Library:** For robust local database storage.
* **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow:** For asynchronous operations and reactive data streams.
* **Material Design 3:** For a modern and consistent look and feel.

## Architecture

TeaJournal follows a clean architecture pattern, primarily leveraging the Android Jetpack components to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

* **UI Layer (Compose):** Composable functions handle the presentation and user interaction (e.g., `MainActivity`, `TeaListScreen`, `AddEditTeaScreen`).
* **ViewModel Layer:** `TeaViewModel` acts as a bridge between the UI and the data layer, managing UI-related data and logic, and exposing `Flow` streams for reactive updates.
* **Data Layer:**
    * **Repository (`TeaRepository`):** Abstracts the data sources and provides a clean API for the ViewModel. It's responsible for fetching data and resolving data conflicts (e.g., from network or local database).
    * **DAO (`TeaDao`):** Defines the methods for interacting with the Room database, providing operations like insert, update, delete, and query.
    * **Database (`AppDatabase`):** The Room database implementation, responsible for creating and managing the SQLite database, defining entities (`Tea`), and providing access to DAOs.
